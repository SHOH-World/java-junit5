# Java-JUnit5
This is a simple framework that integrates Cucumber with JUnit5 using Gradle.

Reason for using Gradle 

    Incremental compilations for Java classes
    Compile avoidance for Java
    APIs for incremental subtasks
    A compiler daemon for faster compiling

## Quick Start
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/SHOH-World/java-junit5.git 
$ 
$ ./gradlew test
```

## Setup
### Requirements
* Used Intellij as IDE
* Plugins installed were 'Cucumber for Java', 'Gherkin'
* Used Java 22.0.1 or higher. Previous versions of Java are un-tested.
* 
*
